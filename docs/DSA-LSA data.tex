In future work for the final version of the paper, the model is going to be calibrated for Greece using annual data covering the period 1995–2024, obtained from Eurostat. This period covers the sovereign debt crisis and the COVID-19 crisis as well as the subsequent consolidation during the adjustment programmes and the post-pandemic period. National accounts data are employed to parametrize the core structure of the economy, while information on government revenues and expenditures are  drawn from general government statistics. Data on population and demographics are also sourced from Eurostat and based on official population censuses and their subsequent updates. To provide a comprehensive overview of public investment in the welfare state-specifically spending on education, health, and military services -- we additionally rely on data classified according to the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG). Estimates of public and private capital stock are then constructed from the series of gross fixed capital formation, using a methodology consistent with the IMF's investment and capital stock dataset.
